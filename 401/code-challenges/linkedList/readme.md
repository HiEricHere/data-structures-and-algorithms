# Linked List
Implement a linked list.

## Challenge
The list should have methods that:
Can insert new nodes
Can check if it includes a value
Can output its list in a string
Can search and insert a node before or after a node with a given value
Can append a node to the end of the list

## Approach & Efficiency
-[x] Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
-[x] Can properly insert into the linked list
-[x] The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
-[x] Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
-[x] Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
-[x] Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
-[x] Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list
-[x] Can successfully insert a node before a node located i the middle of a linked list
-[x] Can successfully insert a node before the first node of a linked list
-[x] Can successfully insert after a node in the middle of the linked list
-[x] Can successfully insert a node after the last node of the linked list
